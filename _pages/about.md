# Hello, I'm Vignesh

I have around 4 years of experience in building Distributed Systems at Scale.

At present, I work at the intersection of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing at [Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/) solving problems in Search Relevance leveraging Deep Learning that learn complex hierarchical structures present in data to understand content.

Prior to this, I worked in [Artificial Intelligence Division](https://research.samsung.com/artificial-intelligence) at [Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore (SRI-B)](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b).
Here, I extensively worked in NLP Research for making [Bixby](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/bixby/) understand natural language and ease the users to handle tasks on device through voice. 
In addition to the above, I was responsible for model deployment, orchestration of the entire pipeline process in Apps domain, and Natural Language Generation to resolve bottle necks in the system.

Much prior to this, I worked in Product Development for Engineering and Research Division at [HCL R&D](https://www.hcltech.com/engineering-rd-services). 
It still feels ecstatic to be remembered of those days :) 
I spent a significant amount of time learning and doing things on the go.
My sincere thanks to all those inspiring people i have met during my tenure here, who helped me shape up my career.
And I can't put down in words on the impact it had created in my professional journey.


## Research

My Primary Research areas lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision.
To be specific, I am interested in developing secure models that could interpret Medical data using 
modern deep learning and computer vision techniques to aid Artificial Intelligence for Healthcare.

If you do have a similar interest, please reach out to me. I'd be happy to collaborate.

Coda,
