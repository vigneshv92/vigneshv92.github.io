## Hello, I'm Vignesh

I have around 4 years of experience in building Distributed Systems at Scale.
At present, I work at the intersection of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing at [Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/).

Prior to this, I worked in [Artificial Intelligence Division](https://research.samsung.com/artificial-intelligence) at [Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore (SRI-B)](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b).

Much prior to this, I worked in Product Development for Engineering and Research Division at [HCL R&D](https://www.hcltech.com/engineering-rd-services).
